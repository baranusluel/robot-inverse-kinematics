# Inverse Kinematics for 6DOF Robot Arms
This is a MATLAB script created to evaluate the inverse kinematics solution of a 6DOF robot manipulator with an Euler wrist that is based on generic industrial robots. It works by substituting values into an analytically predetermined inverse kinematics solution (see below), iterating through the possible values, and testing them through the corresponding forward kinematics.

This script was created by Baran Usluel during high school, for a research project on solving inverse kinematics. The research project was done to fulfill the Higher Level Mathematics Investigation component of the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. The relevant paper can be found here:
